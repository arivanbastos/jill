Jill have two main parts: a **Java library** and an **Android library**.

The **Java library** have general classes that can be used either to desktop as mobile applications. The Java packages are described bellow:

1. fitting: classes that perform curve fitting , predicting the behavior of the location system reference signals.
2. outliers: classes that perform outliers removing from a set of signals.
3. location: classes that perform the location using signals captured by sensors of the devices to identify their position.
4. models: classes that represent the map where the location takes place. In this package are stored classes that represent the signals and signals datasets.
5. utils: utility classes.

The **Android library** have Android specific classes. The Android packages are described bellow:
